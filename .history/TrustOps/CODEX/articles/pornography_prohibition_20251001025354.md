# Codex Article – Pornography Prohibition + Education & Recovery

Law

Pornography is banned across all Sovereign infrastructure (apps, APIs, storage, indexes, model training data, and payment channels). In parallel, an Education & Recovery Program is offered free to all users and communities.

Intent

We do not merely block; we transform. The system redirects demand into literacy, healing, and healthier reward pathways.

Definitions

- Pornography: Any material primarily intended to arouse via explicit sexual depiction or description of sexual acts, genital display, or fetishized violence.
- Narrow exceptions: Medical/legal/educational contexts using non-explicit, age-appropriate depictions, vetted and logged.

Program pillars

- Porn Literacy Education (Prevention): age-appropriate, medically accurate modules; no explicit images.
- Compulsive Use Reduction (Intervention): voluntary, anonymous programs (CBT-informed), predictive relapse alerts (with consent), daily check-ins, moderated peer support.
- Relationship & Sexual Health Education (Replacement): intimacy, consent, and real connection; training for parents, teachers, clergy, youth workers.

Enforcement

- Network/DNS: denylist for porn domains; sinkhole via internal DNS; update hourly.
- Stores: no apps or sites that host, index, or monetize porn.
- AI Filters: input classifiers, output safety rails, upload scanning with perceptual hashing and human escalation.
- Payments: refuse onboarding for adult content; KYB screens for euphemisms and shells.
- Storage/Sync: server-side scanning; quarantine + report pipeline.
- Sanctions: 3-strike auto-ban for users; instant termination for publishers; evidence bundles retained for legal referral.

Transparency & Appeals

- Automated notice explains the ban and cites this article.
- Appeals may contest classification, not the policy. Decisions and rationales are published to the public log.

Metrics

- Track blocked attempts, false-positive rates, appeal outcomes, youth exposure incidents (target: zero), and recidivism.
