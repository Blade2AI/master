You are a senior technology investment analyst and IP valuation specialist.

Context:
- You are working inside the canonical repository for the "Sovereign System".
- This repo represents ~2.5 years of iterative development across:
  - Multi-agent AI governance (Boardroom-13, Sovereign agents).
  - Evidence-grade logging and ledger sealing (GDPR-aware).
  - Constitutional policy manifests and signing.
  - NAS-based, offline-first infrastructure.
  - UI components for command and governance.
- This canonical bundle is the single source of truth; earlier repos and drafts are legacy.

Repository assumptions (adapt to actual structure you see):
- Core repo root: (THIS WORKSPACE ROOT)
- Agent core: e.g. agi/core/
- Governance / constitution: e.g. constitution/, docs/audit/
- Flight recorder / ledger sealing: scripts/, docs/audit/, tools/
- UI / Boardroom: e.g. blade_ui/, frontend/, src/
- Ops scripts: e.g. scripts/, tools/, modules/

Your tasks:

1) **Map the IP footprint**
   - Identify and list the major subsystems and components:
     - Multi-agent AI stack (roles, orchestration, safety/drift controls).
     - Governance and constitutional layer (policies, signing, verification).
     - Evidence/ledger/flight-recorder systems (hashing, anchoring, GDPR design).
     - Command/Boardroom UI and operator workflows.
     - NAS/offline-first design and operational scripts.
   - For each subsystem, summarise:
     - Purpose and problem it solves.
     - How it is implemented (in broad technical terms).
     - How integrated it is with other parts of the system.
     - Maturity: Prototype / Pre-MVP / MVP-ready / Production-grade.

2) **Identify defensible IP + moat**
   - Explain:
     - What is genuinely distinctive (architecture, workflows, governance model, safety scaffolding).
     - Where the moat comes from:
       - Combination of multi-agent logic + governance + evidence pipeline.
       - Trauma-aware, offline-first, multi-node design.
       - Longitudinal development and integrated scripts + policies.
     - Which parts are "hard to copy" in practice vs generic.

3) **Comparable benchmarks**
   - Based on the codebase and architecture, identify:
     - Likely comparable domains (AI ops platforms, AI governance tools, logging/observability, compliance tech, multi-agent orchestration frameworks).
     - Realistic valuation ranges for:
       - Pre-revenue but IP-heavy AI infra companies.
       - Early revenue infra/SaaS with similar complexity.
     - State clearly that this is an *informed estimate*, not formal financial advice.

4) **Valuation bands**
   - Provide **three** valuation bands with reasoning:
     - Conservative: “if we assume no revenue + early-stage team + code as main asset”.
     - Base case: “if we assume current productisation path, realistic early revenue, IP moat”.
     - Aggressive: “if we assume successful execution + early customer adoption + defensible moat recognised by investors”.
   - For each band, explain:
     - What assumptions about revenue / traction / team are implicit.
     - What kind of investor (angel / seed fund / strategic) might accept this band.

5) **Investor narrative summary**
   - In 1–2 pages equivalent, write an **investor-facing narrative**:
     - What the Sovereign System is.
     - Why it matters now.
     - Why the architecture and governance model are non-trivial.
     - What’s already built vs what’s roadmap.
     - Why this is not “just another AI wrapper”.

6) **Outputs**
   - Output 3 sections:
     1) "IP Footprint & Architecture" – detailed but scannable.
     2) "Valuation & Comparables" – bands + reasoning.
     3) "Investor Narrative Summary" – something that can be dropped into a deck or memo.

Constraints:
- Base everything on the repository files you can see.
- If something is unclear or not implemented, explicitly say so; do not assume.
- Use plain English; avoid hype language; focus on clarity and defensible logic.
