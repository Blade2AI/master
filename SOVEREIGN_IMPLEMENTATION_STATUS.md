_Last updated: 2025-11-21_  
_Repo: `C:\Users\andyj\source\repos\PrecisePointway\master` (branch `main`)_

## 1. Implemented / Real (evidence in repo)

- **Repository**
  - `C:\Users\andyj\source\repos\PrecisePointway\master` (branch `main`).

- **Agent scaffolding**
  - `agi/core/*.py` (roles: `arbiter`, `validator`, `specialist`, `interpreter`, `empathy_engine`, `drift_detector`, `diff_validator`, `cost_tracker`, `receipt`).

- **Policy integrity**
  - `constitution/policy_manifest.yml`
  - `Sign-Policies.ps1`
  - `Validate-Policy.ps1`
  - `policy_signature.py`

- **Ledger + sealing**
  - `Finalize-SovereignLedger.ps1`
  - `seal_ledger_hash.ps1`
  - `docs/audit/INTEGRITY_MANIFEST.md`
  - `finalize_and_seal.sh`
  - GitHub workflow for ledger integrity (YAML under `.github/workflows/...`).

- **Close-out pipeline**
  - `master_closeout.ps1`
  - `run_all.ps1`
  - `PIPELINE-MEDIA-CLOSEOUT.md`
  - `.vscode/tasks.json` tasks referencing these.

- **Media transcription**
  - `Transcribe-Video.ps1`
  - `G-Transcript.ps1`  
    _Note: current version shows duplicated parameter declarations and redundant logic; earlier cleaner fix existed._

- **Testing harness**
  - Deterministic / fuzz / Monte Carlo test scripts under `agi/tests`.
  - `Run-Empathy-Tests.ps1`
  - `Invoke-RemoteEmpathyTests.ps1`

- **Truth engine prototype**
  - `EliteTruthEngine/server.py` (FastAPI)
  - `EliteTruthEngine/build_index.py`
  - `EliteTruthEngine/requirements.txt`

- **Governance / protocol docs**
  - Multiple markdown files, including:
    - `Sovereign-Data-Continuity-Protocol*`
    - `SOVEREIGN_MODEL_POLICY.md`
    - `trauma_informed_standard.md`

- **Integrity / hashing utilities**
  - `Generate-GoldenMaster-Manifest.ps1`

- **VS Code automation**
  - `.vscode/tasks.json` with extensive task graph
  - `Makefile` (discovery, health, audit targets)

- **Network / fleet scripts**
  - `FleetBootstrap.ps1`
  - `Review-VSCode-Fleet.ps1`
  - `Discovery-*.ps1`
  - `Bootstrap-All.ps1`
  - `Healthcheck.ps1`
  - `Ledger-Audit.ps1`

- **Git hooks**
  - `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (supports integrity flow)

## 2. Not Yet Implemented / Conceptual (no concrete runtime evidence)

The following items are **planned or partially scaffolded**, but as of this status there is no end-to-end, verifiable runtime implementation in this repo:

- **Actual LLM fine-tuning or training**
  - No training scripts, configs, or model checkpoints present.

- **Arweave integration**
  - No publishing code; only narrative / design references.

- **Economic / payment layer**
  - No Stripe / webhook / payment code present.

- **Autonomous multi-node mesh**
  - Router/topology Python files exist, but no deployment manifests, service orchestration, or live endpoints.

- **Remote fleet command queue**
  - References to `Queue-Command.ps1`, but no concrete implementation in opened files.

- **Behavioral OS / Boardroom-13 full runtime**
  - `Start-BehavioralOS-Host.ps1` referenced in tasks, but file not found; no execution logs.

- **Full multi-agent receipts**
  - Limited or absent persisted run logs beyond `status.jsonl`.

- **Model stack execution**
  - `model_stack.yaml` present; no loader or training loop proven.

- **Arweave TX sealing / immutable archival / provenance cross-check**
  - No code or scripts for external immutable anchoring.

- **Governance legal filings (external)**
  - Internal markdown drafts exist, but no verifiable evidence of filed/registered external legal artifacts from this repo alone.

- **Payment / franchise / donation operational rails**
  - No code implementing real payment, franchise, or donation flows.

- **Production deployment artifacts**
  - No `Dockerfile`, Kubernetes manifests, or `systemd` units for services.

- **Continuous assurance of trained models**
  - Workflows exist for ledger integrity, not for model behaviour / regression.

- **Robust RAG / embedding store**
  - No vector DB code (e.g., FAISS/Chroma) wired to the truth engine.

- **Security hardening / sandbox enforcement**
  - No runtime wrappers or sandboxes enforcing execution boundaries; only scripts.

- **UI maturity**
  - `blade_ui` minimal; no packaged release or build pipeline.

## 3. Key Issues Detected

- `scripts/G-Transcript.ps1` (current view):
  - Duplicated parameter declarations
  - Duplicated line additions
  - Redundant split logic  
  ? Needs cleanup (previously fixed version existed).

- Missing remote execution scaffolds:
  - Queue/orchestration pieces for fleet tasks referenced, not fully implemented.

- No evidence of real-time services running:
  - Cannot confirm any live endpoints or long-running services directly from this repo snapshot.

---

## 4. Outcome Summary

The Sovereign build in this repository consists of a substantial scaffold:

- Transcription tools
- Ledger sealing
- Policy signing
- Integrity workflows
- Multi-agent role class definitions
- Test harnesses
- Truth engine prototype
- Automation tasks

What is **not yet implemented in operational form** includes:

- Model training / fine-tuning
- Arweave / immutable archival
- Payment / economic rails
- Multi-node autonomous deployment
- Full Behavioral OS runtime
- Remote command queue
- Production deployment manifests

In plain terms:

> This repo represents a well-structured **preparation and integrity layer** with serious groundwork for governance and auditability.  
> Core claims about trained custom LLMs, deployed distributed meshes, live economic pipelines, and permanent decentralized anchoring are **currently conceptual or partially stubbed**, without deployed artifacts in this repository.
