# SOVEREIGN NODE LAW v1.0

Effective: Immediately  
Jurisdiction: Local Sovereign System (Andy)

---

## Article 1 — Node Roles

- **PC4 = Sovereign Node 0**
  - Runs Docker and docker-compose.
  - Runs all sovereign scripts:
    - `sovereign_up.py`
    - `integration_verify.sh`
    - `healthcheck.py`
    - agents (`evidence_validator.py`, `property_analyst.py`, etc.)
  - Holds all runtime data:
    - `Evidence/`
    - `Property/`
    - `data/ledger/`
  - Is the **only** machine that may write to the sovereign ledger.

- **PC5 = Viewport Only**
  - No Docker.
  - No sovereign agents.
  - No `Evidence/`, `Property/`, or `data/ledger/` directories.
  - May only:
    - Remote into PC4 (RDP/SSH/VS Code Remote).
    - View dashboards, logs, and reports exposed by PC4.
  - Treat as “eyes only” — no sovereign state is allowed to live here.

---

## Article 2 — Repo & Data Separation (PC4)

The git repository on PC4 **must only** contain code, configs, prompts, and docs.

Runtime data **must never** be committed.

Minimum `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Sovereign runtime data (never commit)
data/
Evidence/
Property/
Governance/Logs/
logs/
*.log

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.venv/
.env

# VS Code
.vscode/
.history/
```

Rule:

> If a file contains real-world evidence, property details, or ledger entries,
> it belongs in `data/`, `Evidence/`, or `Property/`, **never in git**.

---

## Article 3 — Operational Loop (PC4 Only)

All sovereign operations **MUST** be executed on PC4.

Standard loop:

```bash
# Boot sovereign runtime
python3 sovereign_up.py

# Verify integration (tracks, volumes, router, ledger)
./integration_verify.sh

# Ongoing health monitoring
watch -n 60 python3 healthcheck.py
```

Evidence flow (PC4):

* Drop files into: `Evidence/Inbox/`
* Evidence agent processes → `_drafts` (Insider) or `_verified` (Stable)
* Approvals via:

  * VS Code Sovereign extension, or
  * Manual file promotion as per SOP

Property flow (PC4):

* Drop leads into: `Property/Leads/`
* Property agent writes → `Property/Scored/_drafts/` (Insider)
* Promotion to Stable only after readiness/protocol criteria are met.

---

## Article 4 — PC5 Restrictions

On PC5, it is **forbidden** to:

* Install or run Docker for sovereign workloads.
* Create or mount:

  * `Evidence/`
  * `Property/`
  * `data/ledger/`
* Run any sovereign scripts:

  * `sovereign_up.py`
  * `integration_verify.sh`
  * `healthcheck.py`
  * any agent under `src/agents/`

Permitted uses of PC5:

* Remote display for PC4 (RDP/SSH/VS Code Remote).
* Viewing read-only reports and dashboards rendered from PC4.
* Reading repo **code-only** clone without runtime data.

---

## Article 5 — Violation Handling

If any sovereign data or agents are found on PC5:

1. **Immediate action**:

   * Stop all processes on PC5.
   * Remove `Evidence/`, `Property/`, and `data/ledger/` directories from PC5.
2. **Record incident** (on PC4):

   * Append an event to the sovereign ledger:

     * `event_type: "NODE_LAW_VIOLATION"`
     * `node: "PC5"`
     * `action_taken: "data_removed + process_stopped"`
3. **Review**:

   * Confirm docker and agents only run on PC4.
   * Re-affirm this document as controlling law.

---

## Article 6 — Authority

* This document is the controlling local law for node roles.
* Any future orchestration, deployment, or automation must respect:

  * **PC4 = only sovereign execution environment**
  * **PC5 = display / viewport only**

---

## ARTICLE 11 — VORTEX ROUTING LAW (DRAFT ONLY)

> **STATUS:** DRAFT — NOT ENFORCED IN RUNTIME  
> This article describes a proposed future-state routing regime for multi-node Sovereign deployments.  
> It is **not** active. It MUST NOT block, influence, or alter any live routing decisions until
> `FEATURE_VORTEX` is explicitly enabled by Boardroom vote and recorded in the ledger.

### 11.1 Scope

11.1.1 Vortex Routing Law defines additional constraints and health metrics for message paths between logical pods in a multi-node Sovereign mesh.

11.1.2 A **node** is a physical or logical machine participating in the Sovereign mesh (e.g. `node0`, `node1`, `node2`).

11.1.3 A **domain** is a functional class of workload (e.g. `evidence`, `property`, `ops`).

11.1.4 A **pod** is the combination of a node and a domain (e.g. `node0:property`).

11.1.5 A **path** is an ordered list of pods representing the intended route for a message or state transition.

11.1.6 An **epoch** is a configured time window over which mesh health is measured (e.g. one day).

11.1.7 While this article is in DRAFT status:
- Vortex simulations and metrics MAY be logged.
- Vortex constraints MUST NOT cause requests to be blocked, downgraded, or rerouted.
- Any enforcement code MUST be gated behind `FEATURE_VORTEX = True`.

### 11.2 3-Resonance Rule (Critical Path Diversity)

11.2.1 A **critical path** is any path associated with actions that can directly: move/commit funds; create/modify legal filings; change external commitments; alter constitutional configuration.

11.2.2 A critical path MUST satisfy BOTH:
- (a) length ≥ 3 hops; and
- (b) visits ≥ 3 distinct nodes OR ≥ 3 distinct domains.

11.2.3 Non-compliance SHOULD be recorded as `CVF.VORTEX_INSUFFICIENT_RESONANCE` (simulation) and `would_reject = true`.

11.2.4 While DRAFT, 11.2.2 MAY be logged but MUST NOT block execution.

### 11.3 6-Flow Rule (Cross-Node Mesh Health)

11.3.1 Each epoch SHOULD observe ≥ 6 cross-node edges.
11.3.2 If fewer, classify mesh health `DEGRADED_VORTEX_FLOW`.
11.3.3 Simulations SHOULD log this state; readiness SHOULD surface it.
11.3.4 Informational only while DRAFT; MUST NOT alter routing.

### 11.4 9-Activation Rule (Pod Participation)

11.4.1 Across 9 consecutive epochs, each pod SHOULD send ≥1 and receive ≥1 message.
11.4.2 Failure → pod marked **starved**.
11.4.3 Starved pods SHOULD appear in health reports; MAY trigger capacity review.
11.4.4 Advisory only; not a constitutional failure.

### 11.5 Spiral Preference (Heuristic)

11.5.1 A **spiral pattern**: pod revisited after exactly two intermediate hops (A→B→A).
11.5.2 Spiral paths MAY receive a scoring bonus.
11.5.3 Heuristic only; MUST NOT override IAM, track constraints, cost ceilings, or other active checks.

### 11.6 No Dead-End Pods (Topology Smell)

11.6.1 Pod is **dead-end** if for >1 epoch total used edges (in+out) < 2.
11.6.2 Dead-ends SHOULD be logged; MAY generate topology proposals.
11.6.3 MUST NOT auto-edit topology; changes require governance.

### 11.7 Implementation Status

11.7.1 While `FEATURE_VORTEX` = False: DRAFT only; simulation allowed; NO enforcement.
11.7.2 Activation requires: (a) Boardroom approval in ledger; (b) flag set True; (c) tagged release noting activation.
11.7.3 Until activation, MUST NOT be described as active behaviour externally.
