# SOVEREIGN NODE LAW v1.0

Effective: Immediately  
Jurisdiction: Local Sovereign System (Andy)

---

## Article 1 — Node Roles

- **PC4 = Sovereign Node 0**
  - Runs Docker and docker-compose.
  - Runs all sovereign scripts:
    - `sovereign_up.py`
    - `integration_verify.sh`
    - `healthcheck.py`
    - agents (`evidence_validator.py`, `property_analyst.py`, etc.)
  - Holds all runtime data:
    - `Evidence/`
    - `Property/`
    - `data/ledger/`
  - Is the **only** machine that may write to the sovereign ledger.

- **PC5 = Viewport Only**
  - No Docker.
  - No sovereign agents.
  - No `Evidence/`, `Property/`, or `data/ledger/` directories.
  - May only:
    - Remote into PC4 (RDP/SSH/VS Code Remote).
    - View dashboards, logs, and reports exposed by PC4.
  - Treat as “eyes only” — no sovereign state is allowed to live here.

---

## Article 2 — Repo & Data Separation (PC4)

The git repository on PC4 **must only** contain code, configs, prompts, and docs.

Runtime data **must never** be committed.

Minimum `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Sovereign runtime data (never commit)
data/
Evidence/
Property/
Governance/Logs/
logs/
*.log

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.venv/
.env

# VS Code
.vscode/
.history/
```

Rule:

> If a file contains real-world evidence, property details, or ledger entries,
> it belongs in `data/`, `Evidence/`, or `Property/`, **never in git**.

---

## Article 3 — Operational Loop (PC4 Only)

All sovereign operations **MUST** be executed on PC4.

Standard loop:

```bash
# Boot sovereign runtime
python3 sovereign_up.py

# Verify integration (tracks, volumes, router, ledger)
./integration_verify.sh

# Ongoing health monitoring
watch -n 60 python3 healthcheck.py
```

Evidence flow (PC4):

* Drop files into: `Evidence/Inbox/`
* Evidence agent processes → `_drafts` (Insider) or `_verified` (Stable)
* Approvals via:

  * VS Code Sovereign extension, or
  * Manual file promotion as per SOP

Property flow (PC4):

* Drop leads into: `Property/Leads/`
* Property agent writes → `Property/Scored/_drafts/` (Insider)
* Promotion to Stable only after readiness/protocol criteria are met.

---

## Article 4 — PC5 Restrictions

On PC5, it is **forbidden** to:

* Install or run Docker for sovereign workloads.
* Create or mount:

  * `Evidence/`
  * `Property/`
  * `data/ledger/`
* Run any sovereign scripts:

  * `sovereign_up.py`
  * `integration_verify.sh`
  * `healthcheck.py`
  * any agent under `src/agents/`

Permitted uses of PC5:

* Remote display for PC4 (RDP/SSH/VS Code Remote).
* Viewing read-only reports and dashboards rendered from PC4.
* Reading repo **code-only** clone without runtime data.

---

## Article 5 — Violation Handling

If any sovereign data or agents are found on PC5:

1. **Immediate action**:

   * Stop all processes on PC5.
   * Remove `Evidence/`, `Property/`, and `data/ledger/` directories from PC5.
2. **Record incident** (on PC4):

   * Append an event to the sovereign ledger:

     * `event_type: "NODE_LAW_VIOLATION"`
     * `node: "PC5"`
     * `action_taken: "data_removed + process_stopped"`
3. **Review**:

   * Confirm docker and agents only run on PC4.
   * Re-affirm this document as controlling law.

---

## Article 6 — Authority

* This document is the controlling local law for node roles.
* Any future orchestration, deployment, or automation must respect:

  * **PC4 = only sovereign execution environment**
  * **PC5 = display / viewport only**
