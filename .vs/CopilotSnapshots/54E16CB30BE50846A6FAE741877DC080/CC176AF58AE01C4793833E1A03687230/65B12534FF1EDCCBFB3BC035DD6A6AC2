# ??? Sovereign Stack Status
[![Continuous Assurance Status](https://github.com/PrecisePointway/master/actions/workflows/continuous-assurance.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PrecisePointway/master/actions/workflows/continuous-assurance.yml)

Cryptographic ledger integrity is continuously verified (hash + rogue file check) via scheduled CI. Any drift invalidates the build.

# master
Project management file

## Governance script: `sovereign.ps1`
A single-file PowerShell governance stack is available at `scripts/sovereign.ps1`.

Quickstart (Windows, elevated PowerShell recommended):

```powershell
# First time setup (creates directories, keys, initial attestation)
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\sovereign.ps1 -Action setup

# Daily security check
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\sovereign.ps1 -Action security

# Run full governance stack
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\sovereign.ps1 -Action full
```

See `docs/audit/DEPENDENCY_MANIFEST_APPENDIX.md` for dependency manifest governance and CI details.
