- **Coordination**: NAS-based file sharing at \\dxp4800plus-67ba\ops

## CURRENT OPTIMIZATION TARGETS

### Network Performance Goals:
- **Excellent**: <5ms latency (real-time collaboration)
- **Good**: 5-15ms latency (smooth collaboration)
- **Fair**: 15-50ms latency (acceptable with minor delays)
- **Poor**: >50ms latency (requires optimization)

### Configuration Requirements:
```json
{
  "liveshare.connectionMode": "direct",
  "liveshare.allowGuestDebugControl": true,
  "liveshare.allowGuestTaskControl": true,
